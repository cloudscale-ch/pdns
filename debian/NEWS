pdns (4.0.0~alpha1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The "pdnssec" utility has been renamed to "pdnsutil".
  The default listening addresses now include all IPv6 addresses.
  The default DNSSEC parameters have changed to a single ECDSA 256
  key.
  The "lmdb" backend has been removed.
  Many options are no longer experimental.

  Debian specific: the allow-recursion and listen-address parameters
  are no longer set using debconf.

pdns (3.4.6-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  The "geo" backend has been replaced by the much newer "geoip"
  backend. The geoip backend actually has documentation and upstream
  has a higher confidence of keeping it working in newer versions.
