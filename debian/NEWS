pdns (3.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  pdns now ships an empty, but activated bind backend so that the daemon
  can launch immediately. Since PowerDNS only allows a single launch
  statement (see http://wiki.powerdns.com/trac/ticket/502), you need to
  adapt either the new simplebind configuration or your custom
  configuration.

  PowerDNS will not flag multiple launch statements as an error, but it
  will only honor one of them. Be aware of that if your PowerDNS
  complains about configuration for a not enabled backend.
