pdns (3.3-1~exp1) experimental; urgency=low

  The sqlite backend was removed upstream in PowerDNS 3.3. If you're
  using this backend, it is strongly recommended that you migrate to
  sqlite3 or to an entirely different backend. Sorry, there is
  currently no automated migration path. I will accept a tested and
  documented patch for the package if you would like to contribute
  one.
  
  In PowerDNS 3.3, upstream implemented an include directive for the
  configuration file. Unlike the variant that we had patched into
  PowerDNS up to 3.1, the directive is now called include-dir and not
  include, and it only includes file that end in *.conf. If you choose
  to keep your local configuration, you need to make those changes
  manually in your configuration. If you choose to keep your old
  configuration, the postinst takes care of the rename, but you need to
  manually change your include directives to include-dir.
  
  The lazy-recursion parameter has been removed in PowerDNS 3.3.
  If you choose to keep your old configuration, you need to manually
  remove or comment it in your configuration.

pdns (3.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  pdns now ships an empty, but activated bind backend so that the daemon
  can launch immediately. Since PowerDNS only allows a single launch
  statement (see http://wiki.powerdns.com/trac/ticket/502), you need to
  adapt either the new simplebind configuration or your custom
  configuration.

  PowerDNS will not flag multiple launch statements as an error, but it
  will only honor one of them. Be aware of that if your PowerDNS
  complains about configuration for a not enabled backend.
