.SH "NAME"
dnsdist \- tool to balance DNS queries over downstream servers
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fIdnsdist\fR [\-\-help] [\-\-verbose] [\-\-local address] downstream\-address downstream\-address
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
dnsdist receives DNS queries and relays them to one or more downstream servers\&. It subsequently sends back responses to the original requestor\&.
.sp
dnsdist operates over TCP and UDP, and strives to deliver very high performance over both\&.
.sp
Currently, queries are sent to the downstream server with the least outstanding queries\&. This effectively implies load balancing, making sure that slower servers get less queries\&.
.sp
If a reply has not come in after a few seconds, it is removed from the queue, but in the short term, timeouts do cause a server to get less traffic\&.
.sp
IPv4 and IPv6 operation can be mixed and matched, in other words, queries coming in over IPv6 could be forwarded to IPv4 and vice versa\&.
.SH "SCOPE"
.sp
dnsdist does not \fIthink\fR about DNS, and does not perform any kind of caching, nor is it aware of the quality of the answers it is relaying\&.
.sp
dnsdist assumes that each query leads to exactly one response, which is true for all DNS except for AXFR, which is therefore not supported\&.
.sp
The goal for dnsdist is to remain simple\&. If more powerful loadbalancing is required, dedicated hardware or software is recommended\&. Linux Virtual Server for example is often mentioned\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-\-verbose
.RS 4
Be wordy on what the program is doing
.RE
.PP
\-\-local
.RS 4
Supply as many addresses to listen on as required\&. Specify IPv4 as 0\&.0\&.0\&.0:53 and IPv6 as [::]:53\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-daemon
.RS 4
Daemonize and run in the background
.RE
.PP
\-\-help
.RS 4
Provide a helpful message
.RE
.sp
Finally, supply as many downstream addresses as required\&. Remote port defaults to 53\&.
.SH "BUGS"
.sp
Right now, the TCP support has some rather arbitrary limits\&.
